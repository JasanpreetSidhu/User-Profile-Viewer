# User Profile Viewer

This [application](https://jasanpreetsidhu.github.io/User-Profile-Viewer/) displays user profiles by fetching data from an [API](https://randomuser.me) and presenting it in a user-friendly format.

## Key Features

1. **API Integration**: Utilizes the Fetch API to send asynchronous HTTP requests to a user data API.

2. **Data Processing**: Receives and parses JSON-formatted user data from the API.

3. **Dynamic Content Display**: Uses JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM with relevant user information.

4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts the page layout, including background color, based on the user's gender.

5. **Interactive Browsing**: Allows users to view additional profiles with a simple button click.

## How It Works

1. The application sends a request to the API when initiated or when the user requests a new profile.
2. Upon receiving the API response, it extracts key user details from the JSON data.
3. The DOM is then updated to display this information in a structured, easy-to-read format.
4. The page's visual elements, such as background color, are adjusted to reflect the current user's characteristics.
5. Users can explore multiple profiles sequentially by interacting with the provided navigation button.

This application ensures a seamless and engaging user experience while efficiently managing data retrieval and presentation.
